# initiative-tracker-redux

A Redux application to track DnD initiatives. I'm learning how to use Redux, so this is a sample project that is going to be of a decent size to actually stress-test how well the library scales.

The Dungeons and Dragons material that I am using is from the [5th Edition Systems Reference Document](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) only.
